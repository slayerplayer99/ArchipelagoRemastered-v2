If you are new to the game, it can be very overwhelming initially. There are many complex parts of the game but not much informaiton out there to help people get aclimated to the game. This guide is to assist with that issue. Lets get started. <br><br>
<b>Starting out -- searching: <br></b>
You spawn on a random island with sand, grass, tree, and some other various things on the island. For the most part, it's barren. If you have any hope of surviving you'll have to get some tools ready to face the outside world, along with a makeshift raft to traverse these shallow waters. This can be done by using the Search verb under the survival tab. What this command does is search the turf that you're standing on and attempt to find useful items in it. The first step that you want to take is to search standing overtop of some sand. This can yield sand(obviously), rocks, flint and branches. These will be used later down the line in crafting. For now, gather 7 rocks, 3 flint, and 6 branches. <br><br> Now that you have the required materials from the sand move over to a grass turf and begin searching there. Searching in the grass yield all sorts of different seeds, but we'll ignore those for now as they're not necessary. What you're looking for are vines. To finish up your tools you're going to need eight vines. Gather those and we'll move on to the final step. <br><br> Now the last item that we're going to need to get are twigs. These are gathered in a rather simple way, which is plucking from a tree. Walk over to the nearest tree and right click it and select the pluck command. This will either give you a twig or a coconut. Continue doing this until you have two twigs. There you have it, all of the materials that you need to make what I like to call the 'start tools'. Now it's time to combine them all together!<br><br>

<b>Creating the Tools:<br></b>
Now that we finally have all of the materials we need to make the starting tools necessary for survival and the many other exciting parts of the game we can start making them. This process is called combination and is a vital framework to the rest of the game. The combinations of these tools aren't the only ones in the game and there are many other hidden ones to try to find out, good luck! Lets start with making possibly the most important tool, the raft. This allows you to travel over the ocean without combatting the waves. To create this raft you're going to want to go into your inventory tab and drag one branch in the inventory onto the other. If done successfully, this will create a bundle of branches. To finish the creation of the raft drag a vine onto the bundle of branches. Vuala! You have your lifeboat! Walking onto the water will now automatically deploy the raft and safe travels in the water are now easy as can me. Now to move on to the rest of the tools. I'll provide the combination to make them and a brief explanation of what it does.<br><br>

<b>Tools: <br></b>
-Harpoon -- Branch w/ Vine (Branch + Vine) + Sharpened Stone (Rock + Flint), this tool is the standard tool for fishing, used by equipping the tool (double clicking in your inventory) and then double clicking on the water. Don't forget to cook the fish before you eat it though!<br>
-Pickaxe -- Branch w/ Vine + Sharpened Stone, this tool allows you to get ores from cave floor, which can be used down the line to smelt into bars and then smith into useful tools and items<br>
-Hoe -- Branch w/ Vine + Stone, this tool is used to plow the sand and start your very own farm! Another way to combat starvation<br>
-Long Shovel -- Branch w/ Vine + Stone, this tool is used to assist in heavy digging in dirt or sand, use this while you're searching on either of those to help get sand and dirt easier<br>
-Hammer -- Twig w/ Vine (Twig + Vine) + Stone, allows you to build your home with the proper materials and is also used to hammer heated ingots in the smithing process to make bars<br>
-Shovel -- Twig w/ Vine + Stone, this tool is used to dig up plowed fields, along with various other assests<br>
-Hatchet -- Twig w/ Vine + Sharpened Stone, the hatches allows you to cut away from a tree and easily get twigs and branches as well as break down tools by dragging and dropping this tool over others, in case you made a crafting mistake initially<br>
-Fire -- Bundle of Branches + Twig, used to cook food and provide light for those spooky nights alone<br><br>

Now you're ready to combat the elements and survive in the world of archipelago. The world is your to make as you please now and you have to tools to do so. Good luck, and have fun! <br>
Note: I plan on adding more guides down the line on vital survival skills (e.g. fishing) to further assist.
